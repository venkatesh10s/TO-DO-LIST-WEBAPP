# To-Do List Web App

## Overview

The **To-Do List Web App** is a simple yet powerful task management tool that allows users to add, mark, and filter tasks based on their completion status. This app utilizes **localStorage** to ensure that tasks are persistent across page reloads, making it a practical tool for managing daily tasks.

This project demonstrates essential **frontend web development** skills such as handling user input, using **localStorage**, and implementing dynamic content updates using **JavaScript** and **jQuery**.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Users can add tasks to their to-do list.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed by checking a checkbox. Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a **strike-through** effect.
- **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter tasks based on their completion status:
  - **Show All**: Displays all tasks (completed and pending).
  - **Completed**: Shows only completed tasks.
  - **Pending**: Shows only pending tasks.
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are stored in **localStorage** to persist them across page reloads. This means that the task list is saved even if the page is refreshed.
- **Interactive UI**: The app features an interactive user interface with **Bootstrap** styling and **jQuery** for dynamic updates.
- 
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Used for the structure of the page.
- **CSS3**: Applied for custom styling of the tasks and buttons.
- **Bootstrap**: A CSS framework used for responsive layout and easy-to-use UI components.
- **JavaScript**: Used to add dynamic behavior and interactivity to the application, including handling task input, deletion, and completion toggles.
- **jQuery**: Utilized for DOM manipulation and event handling to update the task list.
- **localStorage**: Used to store tasks in the user's browser, so the data persists even after a page reload.

## Open the Project:

After cloning or downloading the project, navigate to the folder where the project is located.
Open the index.html file in any modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

## Run the Application:

The app is purely frontend-based, so you don't need any server-side setup.
Simply open the index.html file to start using the To-Do List Web App.
Note: Since localStorage is used, the tasks will persist in the browser even after you refresh the page.

## How It Works
## Adding Tasks
Enter a Task: Type the task description in the input field at the top of the page.
 ## Add Task
 Click the "Add Task" button to add the task to the list. The task will appear in the task list below the input field.

## Task Display
After adding, the task will show up in the task list with a checkbox. If the task is completed, the user can check the checkbox, and the task will be visually marked with a strike-through.

Task Completion

## Mark as Completed 
To mark a task as completed, the user simply needs to click the checkbox next to the task. Once checked, the task will be visually marked with a strike-through and will be saved as completed in localStorage.

## Mark as Pending
If a task is completed and the user unchecks the checkbox, it will move back to pending status, and the strike-through will be removed.

## Filtering Tasks
## Show All
Clicking the "Show All" button displays all tasks, whether they are completed or pending.

## Completed
Clicking the "Completed" button filters and displays only tasks that have been marked as completed.

## Pending
Clicking the "Pending" button filters and displays only tasks that have not been completed yet.

## Deleting Tasks
## Delete Task
Each task has a "Delete" button next to it. Clicking this button will remove the task from the list and localStorage.
